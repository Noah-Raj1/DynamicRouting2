Scenario 4 - Real-Time Failure Adaptation
Grid Size: 3x3
Node Failure Probability: 0.2
Link Failure Probability: 0.1

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
Step 1:
- Failed Nodes: []
- Failed Links: [((1, 1), (2, 1))]
- Shortest Path Found: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]

Step 2:
- Failed Nodes: [(0, 2)]
- Failed Links: []
- Shortest Path Found: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (2, 0), (2, 1), (2, 2)]

Step 3:
- Failed Nodes: []
- Failed Links: [((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((2, 0), (2, 1))]
- Shortest Path Found: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)]

Step 4:
- Failed Nodes: []
- Failed Links: []
- Shortest Path Found: [(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)]

Step 5:
- Failed Nodes: [(0, 1), (2, 0)]
- Failed Links: [((1, 0), (1, 1))]
- No available path.

Final Outcome:
- Total Steps: 5
- No path found.
