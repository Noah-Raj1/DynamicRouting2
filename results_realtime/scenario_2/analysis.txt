Scenario 2 - Real-Time Failure Adaptation
Grid Size: 3x3
Node Failure Probability: 0.2
Link Failure Probability: 0.1

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
Step 1:
- Failed Nodes: [(0, 2)]
- Failed Links: [((0, 0), (0, 1)), ((2, 1), (2, 2))]
- Shortest Path Found: [(0, 0), (1, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 2)]

Step 2:
- Failed Nodes: [(0, 1), (2, 1)]
- Failed Links: [((0, 0), (1, 0)), ((0, 1), (1, 1))]
- No available path.

Final Outcome:
- Total Steps: 2
- No path found.
